# SSD Install for Jetson TX2
## Hardware
We will be using a [SanDisk 240GB SSD Plus](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-240GB-2-5-Inch-SDSSDA-240G-G25-Version/dp/B00S9Q9VS4), [SATA cable](https://www.amazon.com/SMAKN-22-pin-Female-Power-Extension/dp/B00L9R3AKA/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1517694335&sr=1-3&keywords=sata+male+to+female), and the Jetson TX2 Developer Kit

- Power down Jetson and unplug form power cable. 
- Unpack the SSD and use the male to femal connector to plug the SSD into the SATA connector on the left side of the developer board. Once this has been done you can plug the Jetson back into power and boot up the board using the power button. 


Once you are back into the Linux environment on the Jetson search for the **Disks** utility from the main menu. 

Following the [JetsonHacks](http://www.jetsonhacks.com/2017/03/31/install-samsung-ssd-nvidia-jetson-tx2/) turtorial is trivial. 

Once this is complete you will have your new SSD ready for use and storage.
